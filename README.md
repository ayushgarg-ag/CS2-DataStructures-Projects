# Advanced CS: Data Structures

This repository includes a collection of my projects from Advanced CS: Data Structures -- a course I completed in 11th grade of high school.

The course was designed to follow the second semester of a standard college Computer Science curriculum and extended the concepts of AP Computer Science A with an emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) and design. The primary application of the programming concepts were directed towards modeling data using complex data structures, including one and two dimensional arrays, array lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, linked lists, trees, sets, maps, and heaps. Furthermore, I developed greater proficiency in the development of algorithms, algorithmic analysis, object oriented design, implementing interfaces, and creating and implementing classes to solve common data storage problems.

Topics Covered: Java Programming, Collections, Big-Oh, Lists, Iterators, Stacks, Queues, Maps, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, PriorityQueues, Hashing, Sets

Textbook Used: Lambert, Ken, and Martin Osborne. Fundamentals of Java: AP* Computer Science Essentials for the A & AB Exams. 3rd ed. Boston: Thomson Course Technology, ISBN: 0-619-26723-2.
